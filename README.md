- 👋 Hi, I’m abhishek kumar kashyap whose aim was to be a scientist but things happened and i did electrical engineering but since after doing engineering i was not satisfied i started to study for gate where i spent 2 years and got selected in gate 2 times but since i had a crunch of money i became a sales person worked 2 years only to realise i actually want to solve problems. eventually i figured out biggest problem of my life is money so i started exploring stock market crypto etc soon only to realise i was not able to process those huge data and draw some meaningful conclusions with some certainity then after 3-4 month of struggle i got to know of DATA SCIENCE. and yes thats how i figured out i want to be a data scientist and solve real world problems. i am very glad i found this thing.
